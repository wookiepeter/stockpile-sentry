# stockpile-sentry

Small discord bot written in Rust for the management of stockpiles in the video game Foxhole. 
Also known as: the Bmat-Signal

## Features
What this bot should do: 
    - list stockpiles and respective codes
    - send pings / messages to discord roles, when one of those stockpiles get's close to expiring
    - those messages can be used to reset that refres timer.

## Out of scope of this project 
- automatically retrieve stockpile expiry time from foxhole API (impossible AFAIK) 
- scan and recognize contents of a stockpile (other projects exist for this purpose)
